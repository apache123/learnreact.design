What is React? An illustrated intro (React course for Designers update 2)

Hey DN,

I've been working really hard on the React course for designers since my [last update](TODO). It feels great that I can give you another update!

This post is what I've got so far: [What is React?](TODO).

As you can see, it took way longer than I expected! I have tried perhaps five versions before settling down with the analogies in the article. Hopefully the current version is easy to understand.

BTW: I signed up for a new domain name for the course: learnreact.design.

Let me know what you think!

Thanks,
