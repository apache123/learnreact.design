- props: animation frames

- prop: just like the prop in html tag, it's the configuration of a component


- what are Components
- what are props
  - accessible via: `this.props`
  - read only
- what are states?
  - it is private and fully controlled by the component
- when to use props, when to use states?
- revisit Domo's hat
- Unidirectional dataflow?
- States are things that change -- but props change too?
