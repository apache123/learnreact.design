Converting Material sticker sheet to React (to use with Airbnb's React Sketch.app)?

Hey DN,

I'm considering to convert the [Material sticker sheet](https://material.io/guidelines/resources/sticker-sheets-icons.html) into React so that it can be used with Airbnb's React Sketch.app (which renders React code on Sketch). You can then use it as a template (use it as is or modify it) when designing Android apps.

Does this sound useful? Upvote if you are interested!

Thanks,
Linton
