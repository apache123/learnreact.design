## Sales page outline
### 1. Core frustration
- Coding is hard to learn?
- a ton of gaps between the design and the developed experience
- designer/developer communication issue
- designer's value isn't quite there until it's implemented and shipped
- limited by the dev resources
- React is used in company
- I believe that I learn a react it will make me more completely as professional
-  I spend quite a bit of time narrowing in on the details of a particular mockup screen and when it comes down to the engineering team to translate what I hand off into working code, all of the details I spend so much time on get lost. Rather than be the really annoying designer asking for tweak after tweak, I want to be able to go into the script and tweak those details myself, so that the engineering team can focus on what they do best, and I can make sure the app is presentable! 
### 2. What they want
- design the product better and work with the engineers better
  - better communication with devs
  - I need to learn React so I could create and edit perfect design of components by myself, not asking for devs to “move text label on a button by 2 points higher” for instance
  - Want to have an efficient way to produce design specs/deliverables that are easier for developers to translate/understand/convert into shippable code. I've produced screenshots of designs I've built in the browser (Chrome dev tools FTW), Balsamiq wireframes in a PDF with notes on the side, Balsamiq wireframes hooked up in Invision with comments, high-fidelity mockups from Photoshop in PDFs or Invision, giant interaction flow maps with annotations... sometimes I feel like the developers hate me.
- create a Design systems and UI components by my own.  I believe, that I'll provide a better design with knowledge of React. And this knowledge will improve my collaboration with developers.
- I want to learn React to implement my designs the way I envision them

### 11. Target market
- Who will get the most out of this course?
  -  I’m an UX/UI designer. I started ten years ago as a web designer and did “PSD to HTML” as it called back then, so I know HTML and CSS very good since then. JavaScript is different story though, I could program perhaps only “Hello, World”. Need to learn it to start learning React.
  - I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS and recently started learning javascript after I learned its the foundation for react. 
  - I'm a UI designer. As a lot of ther designers these days, I use Sketch to design user interfaces. I have basic HTML/ CSS knowledge. I can understand basic JS codes though :)
  - I learned front end 3 years ago (html, css, js) and be able to design a static website with code. I have better understanding in html & css, but js less
