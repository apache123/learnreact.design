Curriculum and videos (React course for designers update 4)

---

Hey DN,

I'm thrilled to post another update about the React course for designers! Here are a few things I've done so far:

- The official course name is now "React Essentials for Designers". It's going to cover a range of topics aim to give you a complete picture of how an app is made with React.
- I've fleshed out the curriculum, learning goals and requirements. Please check out [this page](http://www.learnreact.design/re4d/).
- I've created a couple of videos about components, props and state. See [here](http://www.learnreact.design/re4d/#chapter-3) on the curriculum page. My goal is that you should be able to understand the concepts here even without JavaScript knowledge.

What do you think? I'd really appreciate your feedback!

BTW: I have some [other course ideas](http://www.learnreact.design/courses/) based on the feedback I've received so far, but let me focus on this one for now. :)

Thanks,
Linton
