### Previews
To see if you like my teaching style, check out this series of posts: [What is React?](/2017/06/08/what-is-react/) I'll be adding some sample videos here too.

<a name="include">
### What Will Be Included?
- Video lectures that you can stream or download
- An Ebook that you can skim or study at your own pace
- Exclusive access to Slack channel *React For Designers* where you can ask questions and network with fellow designers
- Exercises
- Unlimited updates
- Weekly office hour webinar where I'll go over the most voted questions and you can ask me questions on the spot too (TBD: This is currently only open for people who have pre-ordered the course.)

<a name="goals">
### Learning Goals
The main goal of this course is to help you establish a firm understanding of the fundamentals, capabilities and limitations of React and **how they relate to design**. Armed with a holistic view of how design and engineering interacts, you will become a better designer whom everyone loves to work with.

After finishing the course, you should become aware of how the UI could be structured and constructed in reality when designing the next mockup in Sketch. You should be able to discuss with your developers, with more confidence, on how to design a great UI that's easy to implement, performant and easy to maintain. You should also be able to style the UI of an existing React project yourself -- no more waiting for developers!

To break it down, here are a few verifiable goals to help you work along the course material. After completing the course, you should be able to:

1. explain the following at a concept level (or better yet, since you are a designer, draw diagrams / sketches!):
  - Why are React and React Native cool?
  - How does React fit together with other parts of an app (Redux, Mobx, React Router, Server API, etc.)?
  - What kind of apps is React Native good for, and otherwise?
  - What are components, props and states?
  - When to use props and when to use states?
  - Where does React fit in your design work flow?
2. create a simple component in two different ways and explain the differences
3. create a component that takes user input and update the UI accordingly
4. use React Developer Tool to analyze components in a ReactJS or React Native app
5. explain the pros and cons of the various ways of styling ReactJS and React Native components
6. layout/style an existing component
7. take an existing project, run it, identify where the UI components are, update the layout and styles of specific elements in the app.
8. setup the environment for React Sketch.app and create simple components that render to image layers

If you are struggling with anything above even after completing all the videos and exercises, email me! I'll try my best to help.

<a name="not-about">
### What is this course NOT about?
This is certainly not a course on how to build a complete app. It is not even a course on how to build a full UI on iOS or Android or web.

This is an entry-level course focused on breadth, rather than depth. You'll see high-level explanations of many related concepts, such as DOM, Webpack, Redux and React Router. But you won't find details on how to use them. This is by design. (As an example, check out this blog post: [What is React?](/2017/06/08/what-is-react/))

I think it'd be more effective to first show you a full bird's view of what an app is made up of and how it's implemented. After grasping a complete picture, you'd be able to decide on a subject that's important to you to dive in. For example, if you are involved in a React Native project and want to build UI prototypes, you can take the [React Native Real World UI course](/rnui/).

<a name="requirements">
### Requirements
- You are a designer with a yearning to learn. You heard about this "React" thing all the time and don't want to be left behind.
- You are able to commit 2-3 hours per day for two weeks. The videos will be a few hours long, but you'd learn best if you could invest enough time to finish the exercises, do related research, participate office hours and discuss with fellow students.
- You are familiar with a modern code editor. For JS projects, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You are not intimidated by the terminal and command line. You don't need to be an expert of this but we'll do a bit of work in the terminal, mostly installing things via npm.
- You have some base knowledge of programming, be familiar with HTML and CSS, and can read and edit JavaScript code. I will review some JS concepts that'll be used in the course, but in general I assume you'd come prepared. If you don't, no worries! There are many great resources for you to pick them up, for example, Treehouse's [JavaScript courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/learn/javascript), or Khan Academy's [Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming). If you want, you can even learn both JS and React in parallel and I'll cover some tips on this.

<!--
- Connecting dots
  - How does React fit in design work flow?
  - Sketch <-> ReactJS <-> React Native
  - I'm most interested in being able to translate my designs into React Native code, prototyping in code, and a huge bonus would be connecting it all to Sketch in a way similar to AirBnb.
