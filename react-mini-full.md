## Day 1/8: What is React?

Great move! üôå Welcome to 8-day React for Designers! I'm confident that you are gonna learn something new after finishing the course.

Today let's learn about what this "React" thing really is, and why it's cool. Please read along: [http://www.learnreact.design/2017/06/08/what-is-react/](http://www.learnreact.design/2017/06/08/what-is-react/)

This article has been read by more than 10,000 people and I hope you like it too.

### Homework

Make sure that you can answer the questions in the "[Learning goals](http://www.learnreact.design/2017/06/08/what-is-react/#learning-goals)" section.

## Day 2/8: Components and props
React is all about components. Today let's learn about components and their "props".

Watch this 5-minute video and come back to answer the question in the Homework section: [https://youtu.be/Lr545N_mshY](https://youtu.be/Lr545N_mshY)

### Homework

- Do you remember Domo's hat in yesterday's lesson? (screenshot below). Try to write the simple notation for Domo's hat as I wrote in the video. What props could the components have? 

<p data-height="375" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="gROrXx" data-default-tab="result" data-user="focuser" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Reactive UI" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/focuser/pen/gROrXx/">Reactive UI</a> by focuser (<a href="https://codepen.io/focuser">@focuser</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

- [Tweet your progress](https://twitter.com/home?status=Day%202/8%3A%20Just%20learned%20what%20%23React%20components%20and%20props%20are!%208-day%20%23React%20course%20by%20%40lintonye%20http%3A//learnreact.design/react-mini/). Now you know what React components and props are! 

--- 

## Day 3/8: State

State is what makes our React app interactive. However, many people find state and props confusing when they get started.

In this video, I talked about what state is and how it's different from props: [https://youtu.be/JSMHIF_3LII](https://youtu.be/JSMHIF_3LII)

### Homework

- Recall again Domo's hat, can you add the state in the simple notation you wrote yesterday?
- Remember to [Tweet your progress](https://twitter.com/home?status=Day%203/8%3A%20What%20is%20%23React%20state?%20How%20is%20it%20different%20from%20props?%208-day%20%23React%20course%20by%20%40lintonye%20http%3A//learnreact.design/react-mini/), tell people that you can tell the difference between props and state!

## Day 4/8: Build the House component in JavaScript

Today let's build some real stuff! We'll write some real JavaScript code that draws a house for us. Watch this video and come back for homework: [https://youtu.be/h1Hr_EslNfA](https://youtu.be/h1Hr_EslNfA)

### Homework
- Open and remix this project: [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/react-house-0](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/react-house-0)
- Add wall, window and door to the house
- How can you display two houses?
- üôå You just wrote some real React code! [Tweet your progress](https://twitter.com/home?status=Day%204/8%3A%20Join%20me!%20I%27m%20coding%20%23React%20components%20in%20JS%20now!%20http%3A//learnreact.design/react-mini/%20by%20%40lintonye) and treat yourself some yummy üç©üç™ !

--- 

## Day 5/8: Learn a bit JavaScript
I hope you had fun building the house yesterday. It's now time to learn a bit JavaScript! Of course, to fully master JavaScript it'd definitely take way more than one day. However, I hand-picked 20 minutes of videos plus exercises so that you can just learn enough to proceed with the course. It's more work than the previous few days, but you are up for challenges, right? üòé üí™

Go ahead and register an account on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and finish the following videos and exercises:

- [Intro to variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/p/intro-to-variables)
  - [Quiz: Variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/e/exercise--intro-to-variables)
  - [Challenge: Bucktooth Bunny](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/p/challenge-bucktooth-bunny)
- [More on variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/p/more-on-variables)
  - [Challenge: Funky Frog](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/p/challenge-funky-frog)
- [Functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/functions/p/functions)
  - [Challenge: Say Your Name](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/functions/p/challenge-say-your-name)
- [Function Parameters](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/functions/p/function-parameters)
  - [Challenge: Moles in Holes](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/functions/p/challenge-moles-in-holes)
- [Function Return Values](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/functions/p/function-return-values)
  - [Challenge: Calculator](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/functions/p/challenge-calculator)

Feel free to spread it over a few days if you are busy. Make sure though that you have understood the concepts above before proceeding with the React course.

Remember to [Tweet your progress](https://twitter.com/home?status=Day%205/8%3A%20Join%20me!%20I%27m%20learning%20JS%20variables%20and%20functions%20today!%208-day%20%23React%20course%20by%20%40lintonye%20http%3A//learnreact.design/react-mini/), it's fine to brag a little bit. Just a little bit. üòá

## Day 6/8: Smiley faces in components - JSX and arrow functions
Now that you've wrote some code in JavaScript. It isn't that difficult, right?

Remember the smiley faces when defining a React component? Watch this video and find out what those symbols really are: [https://youtu.be/5WRlEZwxdKM](https://youtu.be/5WRlEZwxdKM)

### Homework
- What is this?
{% highlight jsx %}
() => 1
{% endhighlight %}
- What about this?
{% highlight jsx %}
() => <img src={Images.window} className="window" />
{% endhighlight %}
- What is JSX? Why do we need it?
- Open the previous project that you've worked on on day 4: open https://glitch.com/ and click "Resume Coding"; Open the "App.js" file
- Can you change the definition of the Window component to a named function? Does the app still work?
- Can you convert it to an anonymous function?
- Don't forget to [tweet your progress](https://twitter.com/home?status=Day%206/8%3A%20Join%20me!%20I%27ve%20learned%20JSX%20and%20ES6%20arrow%20functions!%208-day%20%23React%20course%20by%20%40lintonye%20http%3A//learnreact.design/react-mini/)!

## Day 7/8: Blue roof, red roof - Props in JS

### Homework

- Remix this project: [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/react-house-3-6-props](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/react-house-3-6-props)
- In App.js, make the house number on the wall configurable
- Can you make two houses with different roof colors and house numbers?
{% highlight jsx %}
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <House roofColor='blue' number='123'/>
    <House roofColor='red' number='321' />
  </div>
);
{% endhighlight %}

## Day 8/8: Open Sesame! - State in JS

Wow time flies! This is the last day of our React course. I hope you find it useful so far!
