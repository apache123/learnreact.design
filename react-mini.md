### Who Is This Course For?
Product designers, UI designers, Web designers or whoever want to learn React but are not familiar with JavaScript.

That's right! No JavaScript knowledge is needed! You only need to be familiar with HTML and CSS. Concepts are explained in illustrations ðŸŒ´ðŸŽ„ and plain English. I'll also include resources that help you pick up enough JavaScript along the way to understand the course.

### What Will Be Included?
Articles and bitesize video lectures delivered straight to your inbox in 8 days.

### Why should you, as a designer, learn coding?
I encourage you to check out this [post](/2017/05/09/react-for-designers-interviews) to hear other designers' opinions.

Learning to code will help you become better at design. Armed with a better understanding of how things work, you will find the communication with developers much more efficient. Your design ideas would be more convincing and more respected. You can even [design with code](https://blog.framer.com/what-if-a-designer-learns-code-59d790024c9e).

New skills you learn will open new doors. Trust me, it will be a new world of creativity!

### Learning Goals
The main goal of this course is to help you understand the fundamentals of React.

To break it down, here are a few verifiable goals to help you work along the course material. After completing the course, you should be able to:

1. explain the following at a concept level (or better yet, since you are a designer, draw diagrams / sketches!):
  - What is DOM? How is it related to React?
  - Why is React cool?
  - What are components, props and state?
  - When to use props and when to use state?
2. create a simple component in two different ways and explain the differences
3. create a component that takes user input and update the UI accordingly

### Prerequisite
- Be familiar with HTML and CSS
- Understand JavaScript basic concepts such as variables, functions, if statements, objects etc.
