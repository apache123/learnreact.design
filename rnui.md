### Previews
To see if you like my teaching style, check out this series of posts: [What is React?](/2017/06/08/what-is-react/) I'll be adding some sample videos here too.

<a name="include">
### What Will Be Included?
- Video lectures that you can stream or download
- An Ebook that you can skim or study at your own pace
- Exclusive access to Slack channel *React For Designers* where you can ask questions and network with fellow designers
- Exercises
- Unlimited updates
- Weekly office hour webinar where I'll go over the most voted questions and you can ask me questions on the spot too (TBD: This is currently only open for people who have pre-ordered the course.)

### Learning Goals
This course will dive into building a fully functional UI on both iOS and Android. The prerequisite is the [React Essentials for Designers](/re4d/) course.

The main goal is to help you master the coding skills, best practices, patterns, tips and tricks that are required to build modern UIs on both iOS and Android with React Native.

After finishing the course, you should be able to:

1. convert mockups in Sketch or Framer into React Native components
2. build fully functional UI prototypes with native look and feel on iOS and Android
  - iOS and Material Design guidelines
  - native animations and transitions
  - performant UI
3. explain the limitations of React Native: what kind of apps React Native is good for, and otherwise?
4. find and evaluate UI components with a strategy

<a name="requirements">
### Requirements
- You are a designer with a yearning to learn. You want to build full UI prototypes of mobile apps with your own hands.
- You are able to commit 2-3 hours per day for two weeks. The videos will be a few hours long, but you'd learn best if you could invest enough time to finish the exercises, do related research, participate office hours and discuss with fellow students.
- You have either completed [React Essentials for Designers](/re4d/) or have an equivalent understanding of React basics.
- You are familiar with a modern code editor. For JS projects, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You are not intimidated by the terminal and command line. You don't need to be an expert of this but we'll do a bit of work in the terminal, mostly installing things via npm.
