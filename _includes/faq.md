## Why should you, as a designer, learn coding?
I encourage you to check out this [post](/2017/05/09/react-for-designers-interviews) to hear other designers' opinions.

Learning to code will help you become better at design. Armed with a better understanding of how things work, you will find the communication with developers much more efficient. Your design ideas would be more convincing and more respected. You can even [design with code](https://blog.framer.com/what-if-a-designer-learns-code-59d790024c9e).

New skills you learn will open new doors. Trust me, it will be a new world of creativity!

## Why should you pre-order?

- **60% off** the regular price!
- **Zero risk** -- You won't be charged until the planned release date. Plus you can cancel your order anytime until 30 days after launch. No hard feelings. BTW: Some of you might see a $1 charge after placing an order. This is the normal process that my payment processor uses to verify your credit card. The $1 will go back to your card soon after.
- **Start learning sooner** -- I'll send you exclusive content updates while the courses are being created. You don't have to wait until the launch date.
- **Learn what you want to learn** -- The courses are feedback driven. I'll try my best to integrate your feedback into the course materials. It’s a good opportunity to have your influence on creating a great resource for the entire design community. Shoot me an email, I’m all ears!
- **Office hour** -- I'll experiment the idea of weekly webinars where I'll answer your questions. I'm not sure if this would scale after the launch, but I'll do it for everyone who places an pre-order.

In the spirit of transparency, I must share that I'll use the number of pre-orders to gauge the potential of the idea. I'd really like to work on this full-time, but I need to be sure that my time is well spent -- I want to create enough value that you are willing to pay for.

So, if you want a course to see the light of day, please pre-order. It's risk free, and a great way to kickstart your journey of designing with React.

Thank you! I'd really appreciate your trust and support. I'll do my best!

## How to request new content?
[Email me](mailto:linton@jimulabs.com)! Let me know if you want to request new chapters, or a completely new course. I read all emails from you. I'm all ears!

## What if you are not satisfied?
If you are not 100% satisfied with the courses, you can cancel your order at any time before the launch of the course. After launch, you still have 30 days to get 100% refund. No hard feelings!

## What if a course is not released on time?
First thing first, I'll try all my best to release the courses on time, or even before the planned date.

Second, you'll be able to monitor the creation process as I'll keep you constantly posted. Your credit card won't be charged until the planned launch date.

But to be fair, things could happen. If for any reason I'd have to postpone or even cancel a course, I'd get in touch with you. I'd change the launch date when your card would be charged, or give you 100% refund. Remember you can also cancel your pre-orders anytime.
