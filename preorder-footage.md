Goals:

-


Goals:
  - Get to know the world. Learn what's up there, decide whether want to dive in a specific area (e.g. build real world UI with React Native)
  - Understand React basics. Learn enough basic concepts to proceed with hands-on coding
  - Write simple components, layout them out and style them
  - Use core components and some popular components
  - Add simple transitions and animations

- JavaScript premier
  - Review of key concepts
  - ES6, ES7 concepts
  - I know that I should learn javascript before but I also guess that I can learn it in parallel and I'm not sure how to find the balance.
- React fundamentals (concepts)
  - What is React?
  - What is React Native?
  - What are native apps? Why React Native is better?
    - Expo, and its limitations
    - what apps are RN good for? what are not?
  - Components, props, state
    - When to use state and when use prop?
- Related technologies
  - Redux, Mobx
  - It would be nice to have a very basic idea of how apps are constructed on the back end.
  - Get data from API
- React Dev Tool
- ReactJS (all in Codepen)
  - CSS styling vs. JavaScript styling
  - styled components
  - Transitions / animations
- React Native fundamentals (All in Expo snack)
  - Layout with Flexbox
  - Style the UI
  - Core Components
  - Transitions / animations
- React Sketch.app
- React and design work flow
  - I'm mostly trying to visualize what a design file might actually look like.
  - I'm most interested in being able to translate my designs into React Native code, prototyping in code, and a huge bonus would be connecting it all to Sketch in a way similar to AirBnb.


Elon Musk learning methods
  - First principles thinking
  - "it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to."
  - "you boil things down to the most fundamental truths … and then reason up from there."

- Build real world UI with React Native
  - Environment Setup
    - Expo
    - Create React Native App
    - Full setup
      - iOS environment
      - Android environment

- **Understand the constraints of React, design accordingly ([What is React?](/2017/06/08/what-is-react))**
- **Stop waiting for developers, tweak the styles yourself**
- **Hand off assets that your developers love**
- **Empower your design with code, push back when they say it can't be done**
- **Design with code, turbocharge your creativity**
- **Bring your design to life with your own hands**

[//]: - Stop waiting for developers to implement your work
[//]: - Be able to push back when you’re told it can’t be done
[//]: - Talk in their jargon with developers

## What will be in the course?
The main goal of this course is to give you a firm understanding of the fundamentals, capability and limitations of React and **how they relate to design**. I think the most effective way to achieve this goal is to actually build something with React -- with hands-on experience in implementing modern, realistic user interfaces, you'll be able to understand developers' jargon a lot more deeply, compared to, for example, learning about the terms in an article, or over a lunch-and-learn session.

Some tentative topics include:

- Fundamentals
  - React fundamentals
  - UI fundamentals: Layout, styling etc.
- Build realistic prototypes (mobile apps)
  - Animations and transitions
  - Popular components
  - [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)
- Build realistic prototypes (web)
- Design with code
  - Airbnb's [React Sketch.app](http://airbnb.design/painting-with-code/)

## But I'm a designer, why should I learn coding?
I encourage you to check out this [post](/2017/05/09/react-for-designers-interviews) to hear other designers' opinions.

Learning to code will help you become better at design. Armed with a better understanding of how things work, you will find the communication with developers much more efficient. Your design ideas would be more convincing and more respected. You can even [design with code](https://blog.framer.com/what-if-a-designer-learns-code-59d790024c9e).

New skills you learn will open new doors. Trust me, it will be a new world of creativity!


## So where can I download / sign up for the course?
It's still at a very early stage. I plan to gradually develop the course content over a few months. So you are practically witnessing the birth of a brand new course! It's a good opportunity to have your influence on creating a great resource for the entire design community. [Shoot me an email](mailto:linton@jimulabs.com), I'm all ears!

## What should I know before taking this course?
You should have some base knowledge of programming, be familiar with HTML and CSS, and can read and edit JavaScript code. If you don't, no worries! There are many great resources for you to pick them up, for example, Treehouse's [JavaScript courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/learn/javascript), or Khan Academy's [Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).

If you strongly feel that the course should include base programming topics such as JavaScript basics, tell me!

## Who will teach the course?
Me for now. I'm a full-stack developer who's learning design. I've been working on mobile since 2007 and React Native since 2015. I've authored a [course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/animations-and-transitions) about Android animation at Treehouse, and a course on Material Design with React Native on Lynda (in production). I also contribute to [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) project.

## Is this about ReactJS or React Native?
There might be some confusion about the difference between the two. The good news is that they are both called "React" for a reason. Once you learn the fundamental concepts, it will be straightforward to use it for the web (ReactJS), mobile (React Native), Sketch (React Sketch.app), or ReactXYZ.

At least at the beginning, I will focus on teaching React fundamentals with minimal setup requirements. Afterwards, I'll consider to branch into web, mobile or other platforms depending on the demand.

What do you think? [Email me](mailto:linton@jimulabs.com) if you have any suggestions!

Thanks a lot for your interest!
