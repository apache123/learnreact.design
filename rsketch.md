### Learning Goals

Learning goals (TODO: Details coming soon):

- Understand the benefits of using React Sketch.app
- Build a realistic example with the tool
- Understand its limitations

If you are struggling with anything above even after completing all the videos and exercises, email me! I'll try my best to help.

<a name="requirements">
### Requirements
- You are a designer with a yearning to learn.
- You are able to commit 2-3 hours per day for two weeks. The videos will be a few hours long, but you'd learn best if you could invest enough time to finish the exercises, do related research, participate office hours and discuss with fellow students.
- You are familiar with a modern code editor. For JS projects, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You have either completed [React Essentials for Designers](/re4d/) or have an equivalent understanding of React basics.
- You are not intimidated by the terminal and command line. You don't need to be an expert of this but we'll do a bit of work in the terminal, mostly installing things via npm.

### Curriculum
Below is a tentative curriculum of the course. I may add, remove or reorder some sections to make it easy to follow. But no matter what changes I make, they'll serve to achieve the aforementioned [learning goals](#goals) in the most effective way I could find.

- Introduction
  - What will we build?
  - Environment setup
- React Sketch.app Review
- TODO: more details to come
- Conclusion

<!--
- Connecting dots
  - How does React fit in design work flow?
  - Sketch <-> ReactJS <-> React Native
  - I'm most interested in being able to translate my designs into React Native code, prototyping in code, and a huge bonus would be connecting it all to Sketch in a way similar to AirBnb.
