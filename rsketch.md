### Learning Goals
Airbnb's [React Sketch.app](https://airbnb.design/painting-with-code/) allows designers to create a design system that's seamlessly in sync with engineering. This is powerful.

The main goal of this course is to give you a firm understanding of React Sketch.app and have hands-on experience in integrating it into your design workflow.

Learning goals:

- Understand the benefits of using React Sketch.app
- Build realistic examples with React Sketch.app
- Understand best practices on how to integrate React Sketch.app into your current workflow
- Understand its limitations

<a name="requirements">
### Requirements
- You are a designer with a yearning to learn.
- You are able to commit 2-3 hours per day for two weeks. The videos will be a few hours long, but you'd learn best if you could invest enough time to finish the exercises, do related research, participate office hours and discuss with fellow students.
- You are familiar with a modern code editor. For JS projects, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You have either completed [React Essentials for Designers](/re4d/) or have an equivalent understanding of React basics.
- You are not intimidated by the terminal and command line. You don't need to be an expert of this but we'll do a bit of work in the terminal, mostly installing things via npm.

<!--
- Connecting dots
  - How does React fit in design work flow?
  - Sketch <-> ReactJS <-> React Native
  - I'm most interested in being able to translate my designs into React Native code, prototyping in code, and a huge bonus would be connecting it all to Sketch in a way similar to AirBnb.
